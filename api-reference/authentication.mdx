To interact with Personate.ai's Enterprise API, secure authentication is essential to ensure that only authorized users can access. Personate.ai employs API key-based authentication, a widely adopted method for verifying client identity in API communications.

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>'
```

## API Key

To get your Enterprise API-KEY, please contact rishab@personate.ai / hello@personate.ai

## Security Best Practices

Keep Your API Key Confidential: Treat your API key like a password. Do not share it publicly or include it in client-side code.

Regenerate Compromised Keys: If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, regenerate it immediately through the Personate.ai dashboard.

Use HTTPS: Always make API requests over HTTPS to encrypt the data transmitted between your client and the server.

For more detailed information and advanced configuration options, please refer to the documentation.
